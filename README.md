# mental_health_AMoSS
This repository stores the resources to rework on ASRM/QIDS data collected from AMoSS study. <sup>1<sup>

Basically, the analysis is signature-based. <sup>2<sup> 
  
All the results are contained in preprint **Deriving information from missing data: implications for mood prediction**
  
Getting Started
---------------

Once the repo has been cloned locally, setup a python environment with ``python==3.7`` and run ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

As the data were collected pre-GDPR and contained sensitive personal data, it cannot be placed into a publicly accessible repository. Requests for access to the data can be made to the data controller G.M.Goodwin. 

Notebooks for results
---------------
The results have been collected and shown in different jupyter notebooks, namely, ``ROC_classification.ipynb``, ``classification_task.ipynb`` and ``prediction_tasks.ipynb``.
